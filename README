Barvocuc
========

Software for Color Image Analysis


Installation
------------

For Windows, a package with the graphical interface is available at
[the GitHub releases page](https://github.com/encukou/barvocuc/releases).
Select the first `barvocuc-gui.exe` file there.

For other systems, and for using the non-interactive interface,
`barvocuc` can be installed as a Python package on Python 3.5 or greater.
Required libraries (such as `Numpy`, `Scipy`, `Pillow` and `PyQT`) should
be installed automatically this way.

The command to install varies slightly between environments.
On most Linux distributions,it is:

    python3 -m pip install --user barvocuc[gui]

In a Python virtual environment, enter:

    python -m pip install barvocuc[gui]

If using as a library, leave off the `[gui]`.
If you need to use configuration files from Barvocuc 1.0, use `[gui,oldconf]`
instead of `[gui]`.


Usage
-----

### GUI

The graphical interface can be started with:

    barvocuc gui

The interface allows setting analysis parameters (thresholds for individual
colors, model version) and adding images to analyze.
When an image is added or selected, it and its analysis results can be viewed
in views at the bottom of the window.
Additional views canbe enabled via the "View" menu.

When images are added and parameters set, numerical results can be exported
to CSV format (either to file or to the clipboard).
Also, results can be saved to directory; this outputs result images as well
as the CSV.

The parameters can be saved to and restored from files using menu options.


### Batch processing

Non-interactive processing is done using the command:

    barvocuc analyze IMAGES

(Substitute source images or directories for `IMAGES`.)

This outputs analysis results to standard output as CSV.

To save results to file instead, use `-o FILE.csv`.

To save results including images, use `--outdir DIRECTORY`.


### Library

Barvocuc also works as a Python library.
Example usage:

    from barvocuc import ImageAnalyzer
    with open(filename, 'rb') as img_file:
        analyzer = ImageAnalyzer(img_file)

    print(analyzer.results['red'])

The `Analyzer` objects have dict-like attributes `results` (numerical results),
`arrays` (Numpy arrays), and `images` (Pillow images).
To see which results are available, see for example:

    for key in analyzer.results:
        print(key)

### Release checklist

Releasing the software is still a bit cumbersome.
If you're the maintainer, you can follow these steps to get a release out:

* [ ] Install tools and test deps: `python -m pip install twine -e.[test]`
* [ ] Run `make` to regenerate message catalogs. Commit if necessary.
* [ ] Run tests: `python -m pytest test_barvocuc`
* [ ] Update the version number in `setup.py`
* [ ] Make the release `rm -rvf dist/ ; python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel`
* [ ] Check files from `dist/` by installing into a fresh virtualenv.
* [ ] Switch to branch `appveyor`, commit `barvocuc/translations/*.qm`, push
* [ ] Wait for [Appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/encukou/barvocuc/history) to successfully build
* [ ] Tag and push the commit that changed `setup.py`
* [ ] Run `twine upload dist/*` to release on to PyPI
* [ ] Add release notes and Appveyor result to Github Releases
